<div  style="margin-right: 40px;margin-left: 40px;"><p>This article surveys the PDF Association‚Äôs focus on
    accessibility, from advancing accessible PDF to promoting accessibility in ISO standards
    documents, and ensuring broad access and opportunity for all within its own
    operations.</p>
    <p>Founded in 2006 as the ‚ÄúPDF/A Competence Center‚Äù, since 2010 the organization has
        grown to encompass the PDF format as a whole. Today, the PDF Association provides a
        vendor-neutral meeting-place for PDF technology stakeholders while working to
        increase awareness and adoption of ISO-standardized PDF technology, including for
        accessibility.</p>
    <h2>ISO 14289-1 (PDF/UA-1), the ISO standard for accessible PDF</h2>
    <p>In 2012, after eight years of development led by PDF Association members, ISO
        published <a href="https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-14289-pdfua/">ISO 14289-1</a>,
        better known as PDF/UA (Universal Accessibility), to define requirements for the use
        of PDF‚Äôs Tagged PDF feature as defined for PDF 1.7 (2008). PDF/UA-1 was published in
        the early stages of the development of PDF 2.0, which began in 2009, and the lessons
        gained in creating PDF/UA-1 were put to use in the redevelopment of Tagged PDF in
        PDF 2.0.</p>
    <p>The PDF Association caused PDF/UA-1 to be the first ISO standard worldwide, on any
        subject, to itself meet standards for accessibility. As a tagged and validated PDF
        file, ISO 14289-1 thus conformed, not only with WCAG 2.0, but also with itself. üòâ</p>
    <h2>Support for NVDA</h2>
    <p>Also in 2012, the PDF Association celebrated the publication of PDF/UA by <a
            href="https://pdfa.org/nvda-goes-pdfua-the-pdf-association-steps-up-to-fund-development-of-the-worlds-first-pdfua-conforming-screen-reader/">supporting
        development of NVDA</a>, the free and open source screen reader.</p>
    <h2>Best practice, test-suites and more</h2>
    <p>Since the publication of PDF/UA-1 the <a
            href="https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-ua-technical-working-group/">PDF/UA TWG</a>
        and <a href="https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-accessibility-liaison-working-group/">PDF
            Accessibility LWG</a> have developed a variety of resources to assist
        developers, end users and other stakeholders interested in driving accessibility in
        PDF content. The results of these efforts include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://pdfa.org/resource/the-matterhorn-protocol/">The Matterhorn
            Protocol</a>, now at version 1.1, is a set of tests covering all of PDF/UA-1‚Äôs
            requirements.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://pdfa.org/resource/tagged-pdf-best-practice-guide-syntax/">The
            Tagged PDF Best Practice Guide: Syntax</a>, provides advice beyond the technical
            requirements defined in PDF/UA.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://pdfa.org/resource/pdfua-reference-suite/">The PDF/UA Reference
            Suite</a>, a set of ‚Äúreal-world‚Äù PDF files usable as a demonstration of how PDF
            files should be tagged.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-ts-32005-hierarchical-inclusion-rules/">Hierarchical
            inclusion rules for PDF 1.7 and PDF 2.0 structure elements</a> used by <a
                href="https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-32005/">ISO 32005</a>.
        </li>
        <li>The <a href="https://pdfa.org/glossary-of-accessibility-terminology-in-pdf/">glossary
            of accessibility terminology in PDF</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Tagged PDF redefined in ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0)</h2>
    <p>Led by the then-chairman of the PDF Association, callas software‚Äôs <a
            href="https://pdfa.org/people/olaf-drummer/">Olaf Dr√ºmmer</a>, one of PDF 2.0‚Äôs
        most significant upgrades was the re-development of the section defining Tagged PDF,
        setting the stage for PDF/UA-2.</p>
    <h2><a id="using-tagged-pdf"></a>Well-Tagged PDF (WTPDF)</h2>
    <p>PDF accessibility is one of several use-cases for ‚Äúreuse‚Äù of tagged PDF. Other
        use-cases include expression as HTML, copy and paste functionality, content
        extraction for use by search engines, and more.</p>
    <p>Following publication of the 2nd edition of PDF/UA-1 in 2014, the PDF Association‚Äôs
        <a href="https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-ua-technical-working-group/">PDF/UA
            Technical Working Group</a>, later joined by the <a
                href="https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-reuse-twg/">PDF Reuse TWG</a>, began to
        develop a new specification for tagged PDF based on PDF 2.0.</p>
    <p>Intended for publication by the PDF Association, "<a href="https://pdfa.org/wtpdf/">Well-Tagged
        PDF (WTPDF): Using Tagged PDF for Accessibility and Reuse in PDF 2.0</a>" was
        developed in full alignment with ISO TC 171 SC 2 WG 9, the working group developing
        ISO 14289-2, to ensure its compatibility with the forthcoming ISO standard for
        accessible PDF 2.0 files.</p>
    <h2>ISO 14289-2 (PDF/UA-2)</h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, the text of PDF/UA-2 (to be published in Q1 of 2024) was
        developed by PDF Association working-groups working in coordination with ISO‚Äôs TC
        171 SC 2 WG 9. Comments from the ISO committee members were fed back into the PDF
        Association's development process to ensure 100% alignment between the new ISO
        standard and the PDF Association‚Äôs specification for Well-Tagged PDF.</p>
    <p>Building on PDF 2.0, PDF/UA-2 is a dramatic improvement on PDF/UA-1. For the first
        time it includes comprehensive provisions for annotations and structure element
        attributes, both of which are mostly absent in PDF/UA-1. PDF/UA-2 also leverages PDF
        2.0 in many other ways, from the new Namespaces feature that allows for integration
        of PDF 1.7 and PDF 2.0 structure elements in the same document to MathML, the new
        Artifact structure element type, and much more.</p>
    <h2>Encouraging accessible ISO standards</h2>
    <p>Since 2014 the PDF Associations‚Äôs PDF/UA Technical Working Group has operated in
        close coordination with the ISO working group responsible for PDF/UA, TC 171 SC 2 WG
        9. Starting in 2021, members of these groups came together to conduct an assessment
        of ISO‚Äôs products and procedures from the accessibility perspective. This work
        culminated in 2022 with delivery to ISO of a report by the TC 171 SC 2 Chair
        Advisory Group (CAG) identifying areas of concern and making recommendations for
        enhancements. The PDF Association continues working actively with ISO to identify
        and mitigate accessibility issues with ISO‚Äôs document production and committee
        workflows.</p>
    <h2>Working Groups with an accessibility focus</h2>
    <p>As of early 2024 the PDF Association operates 20 active Working Groups. Of these, 4
        are directly engaged in advancing accessibility in PDF technology while 2 other
        groups are dedicated to subjects that track closely with accessibility.</p>
    <h3>PDF Association WGs dedicated to accessibility</h3>
    <p><a href="https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-ua-technical-working-group/">PDF/UA TWG </a>Together
        with the PDF Reuse TWG, this WG led development of the specification for Well-Tagged
        PDF, the which is mirroned in the file format requirements in ISO 14289-2
        (PDF/UA-2).</p>
    <p><a href="https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-accessibility-liaison-working-group/">PDF
        Accessibility LWG </a>This WG develops techniques for accessible PDF, with its first
        set of ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù techniques slated for publication in Q1 2024. In October 2023
        the working group published an <a
                href="https://pdfa.org/pdf-techniques-for-accessibility-a-new-model/">example</a>
        of what is to come.</p>
    <p><a href="https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-ua-processor-lwg/">PDF/UA Processor LWG </a>This
        WG focuses on recommendations and requirements for software engaged in processing
        PDF/UA files. As of 2024 the group is focused on examining accessibility API role
        mappings for HTML elements and WAI-ARIA / DPub attributes with the objective of
        mapping these features to their functional equivalents in PDF. <a
                href="https://pdfa.org/bridging-pdf-and-web-accessibility/">Read more</a>
        about their progress.</p>
    <p><a href="https://pdfa.org/community/latex-project-lwg/">LaTeX Project LWG </a>The <a
            class="extlink https" href="https://www.latex-project.org/" rel="noopener"
            target="_blank">LaTeX Project<sup></sup></a> is working to enhance the
        LaTeX typesetting system used by academic and technical authors worldwide to deliver
        complete support for the creation of structured document formats, in particular,
        Tagged PDF and PDF/UA. This LWG provides a workspace for LaTeX developers andPDF
        experts to share their expertise to advance both LaTeX and Tagged PDF</p>
    <h3>PDF Association WGs related to accessibility</h3>
    <p><a href="https://pdfa.org/community/pdf-reuse-twg/">PDF Reuse TWG </a>In addition to
        its collaboration with the PDF/UA TWG on the development of Well-Tagged PDF and
        PDF/UA-2, this WG focuses on general reuse of Tagged PDF to deliver advanced support
        for conversion to HTML, copy and paste applications and other instances of content
        reuse.</p>
    <p><a href="https://pdfa.org/community/deriving-html-from-pdf-twg/">Deriving HTML from
        PDF TWG </a>Author of the usage specification ‚Äú<a
            href="https://pdfa.org/resource/deriving-html-from-pdf/">Deriving HTML from
        PDF</a>‚Äù published in 2019, this working group focuses on leveraging Tagged PDF for
        this common content reuse case.</p>
    <h2>An ongoing commitment to accessibility</h2>
    <p>PDF‚Äôs core value proposition implies extreme flexibility in the representation of
        content. Accordingly, although accessible PDF has been possible for a long time,
        achieving it still offers challenges, depending largely on document complexity.
        Accordingly, the PDF Association will remain committed to developing resources that
        help all stakeholders, software developers, institutions and end users alike, to
        develop software to support accessible PDF, set policies for publication and
        acquisition, and author PDF files that meet accessibility standards.</p>
